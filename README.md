# MyPass Repository

MyPass is a simple password manager built using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows users to generate secure passwords, store them along with the corresponding website and email/username, view saved passwords, and update passwords if needed.

## Functionalities

### 1. Generate Password
- Clicking the "Generate Password" button will create a random strong password consisting of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols.
- The generated password will be copied to the clipboard automatically, making it convenient for users to use it immediately.

### 2. Store Password
- Users can enter the website, email/username, and password in the provided fields.
- Clicking the "Store Password" button will save the entered details to a file named "passwords.txt".
- Before saving, it will prompt the user to confirm whether they want to save the details.

### 3. View Saved Passwords
- To view saved passwords, the user needs to provide the master password (predefined as "password").
- Clicking the "View Saved Passwords" button will open a new window displaying all the saved passwords in a user-friendly format.
- The saved passwords are read from the "passwords.txt" file and displayed in the window.

### 4. Update Password
- Users can update the password for a specific website.
- They need to enter the website and the new password they want to use.
- Clicking the "Update Password" button will search for the website in the "passwords.txt" file and update the corresponding password.
- If the website is not found, it will show an appropriate message.
